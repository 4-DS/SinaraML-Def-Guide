ML system, ML Pipeline and Model Monitoring 
*******************************************

ML system, ML Pipeline and Model Monitoring are the central concepts of ML model development and operation. A productive conversation about systematic ML model development is impossible without an understanding of these concepts

**ML system** is a set of components necessary for systematic development and operation of ML models. This is how Google depicts the ML system:

This is how Google explain it: https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning

This wow picture and hardcore article certainly makes an impression. But there is one nuance that leads the reader to often bypass these recommendations and think that they do not apply to his situation. The nuance is that the complexity of Google articles is many times greater than the complexity of the task at hand, and the resources and competencies required to understand the article are often far beyond the reader's resources and competencies. You will be lucky if the reader of this article is a representative of the new emerging MLOps profession. If your company already has an MLOps department, you're probably well past the point and don't need to be told what an ML system and ML pipeline are. But even for you, we recommend continuing reading, as the Synara ML Definitive Guide is an attempt to rethink current ML practices and offer the easiest and cheapest possible approach to developing ML models. This approach can be applied  without special skills by anyone in the ML profession (including managers of software products that use ML). The approach is so cheap that it can be used even by the smallest teams engaged in Data Science; for example, consisting of just one Data Scinetist.

.. note::
  Below is a poorly structured text that is not readable yet.

.. note::
   This is note text. Use a note for information you want the user to
   pay particular attention to.

   If note text runs over a line, make sure the lines wrap and are indented to
   the same level as the note tag. If formatting is incorrect, part of the note
   might not render in the HTML output.

   Notes can have more than one paragraph. Successive paragraphs must
   indent to the same level as the rest of the note.

More is needed, including:

1. Ð¡I/CD
2. Data Handling
3. ML pipelines
4. More Computing Power
